# Minesweeper

Minesweeper is a single-player video game. The object of the game is to clear an abstract minefield without detonating a mine. You can flag a mine by right click. When in a doubt you can mark the cell as unsure by right clicking again.

## Rules and basics

The object of the game is to find the '_safe_' squares as fast as possible while avoiding the mines.

## The Board

Minesweeper has three standard boards to choose from, each progressively more difficult.
- Easy: 7 * 5 board (35 tiles), 5 mines
- Medium: 10 * 7 board (70 tiles), 15 mines
- Hard: 15 * 15 board (225 tiles), 40 mines
- Custom: Your custom combination of number of tiles and mines for practice. (19 * 19 board is the largest)

## How to play

The rules in Minesweeper are simple: 
- Uncover a mine, and the game ends.
- Uncover an empty square, and you keep playing.
- Uncover an empty square, and it tells you how many mines lay hidden in the eight surrounding squares—information you use to deduce which nearby squares are safe to click.

## Hints and tips

- Mark the mines. If you suspect a square conceals a mine, right-click it. This puts a flag on the square. (If you're not sure, right-click again to make it a question mark.)
- Study the patterns. If three squares in a row display 2-3-2, then you know three mines are probably lined up beside that row. If a square says 8, every surrounding square is mined.
- Explore the unexplored. Not sure where to click next? Try clearing some unexplored territory. You're better off clicking in the middle of unmarked squares than in an area you suspect is mined.
